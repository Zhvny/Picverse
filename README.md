# Picverse

**Picverse** is a final project developed as part of the **Human Computer Interaction (HCI)** course in Semester 2.

This project aims to apply the principles of interface design and user experience (UI/UX) into a digital artwork exploration platform. Through *Picverse*, users can browse various categories of artwork, view artistic details, and experience an intuitive and aesthetic interaction flow.

Designed with a user-centered design approach, *Picverse* is the result of continuous exploration of ideas, prototyping, and iteration in accordance with modern HCI methodologies.

> Created with research, design, and a little bit of deadline pressure.
